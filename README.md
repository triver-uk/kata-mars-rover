# kata-mars-rover

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet.

This plateau must be navigated by the rovers so that their onboard cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

Your task is to develop an API that translates the commands sent from Earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.
